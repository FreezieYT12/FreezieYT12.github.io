      In Statutory Roleplay one of the many things we offer the ability to own your<br>
      own car dealership, for example, these are the localy owned dealerships.<br>
      As a dealership owner, you will have to first, buy the dealership obvously.<br>
      Then you have to make sure you have enough money for the cars that your going<br>
      to be selling in your dealership because, you have to pay to buy the cars to<br>
      put them into stock. But don't, worry you can hire employees to do the simple<br>
      things like that for you, and they get comission per car that they deliver to<br>
      the dealership, so you don't have to worry about direct payment.<br>
